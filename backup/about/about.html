						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dhaka Ahsania Mission is a non-profit voluntary organization in Bangladesh. The Mission was established in 1958 by Khan Bahadur Ahsanullah, an outstanding educationist and social reformer of undivided India. With his own vision of a better society, characterized by a wealth of moral and spiritual values of the highest humanism that are universally acclaimed through ages and manifested in every sphere of life–social, economic and cultural; and access to education and resources, he established the Mission. His remarkable educational reforms include among others introduction of roll number system in the public examination and creating equal opportunity for education of all groups of people in the society.
